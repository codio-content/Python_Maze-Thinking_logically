On the left hand side is a game with nothing in it whatsoever. You are soon going to add things into the game. 

To start off with, we are going to use command blocks to represent the instructions. You can drag commands from the left hand toolbox into the white area on its right. 

## Your first tiny program

Start off by dragging in the command 

- Create Random Maze

It should look like this

Once you have done this, you can run the game by pressing the Reload button in the game

What you have done here is to execute a single instruction that creates a maze with a random number of walls, monsters and energy stores.

Press the Reload button again and you will see you get a different maze each time.
