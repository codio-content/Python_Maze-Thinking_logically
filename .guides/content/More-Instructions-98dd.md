Now let's add more commands so you have more control over the game.

In the toolbox on the left, you can see we have a bigger set of commands.

You can see that some of the commands have a place where you can enter a value for the X and Y coordinate. 

**You don't have to fill in the X and Y values at this point, though you can if you want to.**

- **Add Player** adds the player
- **Add Goal** adds the goal the player should reach
- **Add Wall** adds a wall section into the maze at a random location
- **Add Monster** adds a monster
- **Add Energy** adds an energy store

Play around with these commands, making sure you start off with a 'Create Empty Maze' instruction.
