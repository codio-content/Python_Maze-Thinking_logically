Now we're going to see how to achieve exactly the same thing with Javascript.

Take a look at the code on the left. We've put in a few lines to start you off.

## Arguments
```javascript
addMonster(4, 2)
```

We're not talking about having a verbal battle here. The 4 and the 2 in the brackets are called **arguments**.

If we specified `addMonster()` without any arguments then you can see that a monster gets added, but at a completely random location.

If we **do** specify arguments, then we get a monster at the position we specify.

The first argument `4` is the X coordinate and the second argument `2` is the Y coordinate. 

## Change it
Go ahead and change the following and see what happens.

- add 2 coordinate arguments to the `addWall()` function call.
- remove the coordinates from the `addMonster()` function call.
- Feel free to add more lines
