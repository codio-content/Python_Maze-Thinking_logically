We are now going to do the exact same things with a proper programming language - Python.

Over on the left hand side is the 3 monster challenge written using Python.

## Functions
In Python, the 'Create Empty Maze' instruction is represented like this.

```python
createEmptyMaze()
```

The `()` means that `createEmptyMaze` is a function. A function contains its own set of instructions that are hidden away and you don't need to worry about at all. All you need to know is that it does what you want, which in this case is to generate the whole maze but with nothing in it.

### No spaces!!!
When you are using function names in Python, you should not use spaces. So `create Empty Maze()` would give an error.

```python
addMonster()
```

This is all it takes to add a monster.
